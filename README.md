Blue Serial
===========

Blue Serial is an Android app which is compatible and tested on Android versions 2.2 to 4.2.2. The app itself is designed to allow for Serial communications over Bluetooth to devices such as Arduino. It has been tested with the JY-MCU serial bluetooth module but there is no reason to believe that it won't work with any other device.

It is fairly straightforward and allows for 2 way communication.

===============

The entire project has been developed in Eclipse Juno (4.2). First, you need to clone the project using:

git clone https://github.com/plastygrove/BlueSerial.git

Then import the project into Eclipse using File->New->Project...->Android->Android Project from Existing Code and follow the instructions
